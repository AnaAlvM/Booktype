How to make new CSS files from the templates
============================================

This folder contains all the CSS files used by Booktype 2.*.
The colour values have been replaced with placeholders. This
allows to easily create new colour schemes for a new instance.

The colour placeholders are:

#text-general

This is used for links and headlines.

#button-background-lighter
#button-background-darker

These two are for backgrounds like buttons and panels. 
They are also used for transitions in the pulldown menues. 
If you want no transitions, give both the same value.

#border-verydark

A darkish border used for buttons.

#button-alt-background

There is one alternative background colour, for example
for the "info" button in the editor screen. 

If you are using a linux system, you can replace these
placeholders in all CSS files by using the 'sed' command
inside the CSS folder. Below you can see a list of such
commands we used to create the orange theme of the current
Booktype theme.

#!/bin/bash
#
# Text and link color with dark orange
sed -i 's/#text-general/#E55B00/g' *.css
# background and border
sed -i 's/#button-background-lighter/#FF6600/g' *.css
sed -i 's/#button-background-darker/#E55B00/g' *.css
sed -i 's/#border-verydark/#232f3e/g' *.css
# blue background with light blue
sed -i 's/#button-alt-background/#146eb4/g' *.css
