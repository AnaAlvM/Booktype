Installing Booki
----------------

Note : there are three components to the Booki Tool Set. This doc
covers only the Booki (editor/book manager) component and not Espri
(importer) or Objavi (exporter). By default Booki is hardwired to the
FLOSS Manuals install of Objavi and Espri so you still acquire that
functionality. To detach yourself from the FLOSS Manuals mothership
you need to install Espri and Objavi and configure your install of
Booki accordingly.

This document describes how to install the latest stable versions of 
Django, simplejson, and Redis, using python's easy_install.  If you 
have a sufficiently recent distribution (e.g., Debian Squeeze), you 
can just use the distro versions.  In that case, skip the easy_install 
steps and do whatever is appropriate with your package manager.


Booki prerequisites
-------------------
 - Python, minimum 2.5 (http://www.python.org/)

 - PostgreSQL (recommended) or Sqlite3

 - git repository manager (http://git-scm.com/)

       $ sudo apt-get install git-core

 - Python Set Up Tools

       $ sudo easy_install -U setuptools

 - Django, minimum 1.2 (http://http://www.djangoproject.com/)

       $ easy_insyall django

 - SimpleJSON

       $ easy_install simplejson

 - Redis (http://redis.io/)

       $ sudo apt-get install redis

 - South (http://south.aeracode.org/)

       $ easy_install South

 - lxml (http://codespeak.net/lxml/)

       $ easy_install lxml
      

Installing from the git repository
----------------------------------

This install doc uses sqlite3 as its the easiest to setup so make sure
sqlite3 is installed. Do all of the steps as regular user or www-data user.

1. Clone Booki

git clone git://booki-dev.flossmanuals.net/git/booki.git

2. Change dir to 'booki'

cd booki/scripts

3. Create booki instance

./createbooki --database sqlite /var/www/mybooki/  

4. Change directory

cd /var/www/mybooki/

5. Edit settings

vi settings.py

6. Load environment variables

. ./booki.env

7. Initialize database

django-admin syncdb

8. Migrate

django-admin migrate

9. Start redis (If you are using the distro's Redis server, this may
not be necessary or desirable).
redis-server &

10. Start the whole thing 
django-manage.py runserver

Then if all is well open your browser and point to something like:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/


How to use Booki with Apache and mod_wsgi
-----------------------------------------

To install Booki with Apache, you need to use WSGI or FCGI/SCGI.  Consult the
Django documentation at
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/.

Createbooki script has created booki.wsgi script for the Apache. Use that
file as part of your Apache config.


How to migrate to Booki 1.1
---------------------------

1. Install Booki again with 'createbooki' script

2. Change configuration in new setting.py (compare it with old configuration)

3. Change attachment path in database. Please change OLD_PATH and NEW_PATH to point to new directories. If you don't do this, attachments will not be accessable.

   $ django-admin shell
   >>> from booki.editor import models
   >>> OLD_PATH = '/Users/aerkalov/Work/git/booki/site_media/static/'
   >>> NEW_PATH = '/Users/aerkalov/Work/git/mybooki/data/books/'
   >>>
   >>> for att in models.Attachment.objects.all():
   ...     print '>> ', att.attachment.name
   ...     name = att.attachment.name.replace(OLD_PATH, NEW_PATH)
   ...     att.attachment.name = name
   ...     att.save()
   >>>
